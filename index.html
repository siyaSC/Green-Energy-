      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>Green energy is energy that is non-polluting and it is more sustainable than fossil fuels.
         With the energy crisis in South Africa, the need for alternative energy sources has never been more apparent.
        Green energy alternatives not only keep your lights on but they also keep us safe from extreme climate conditions 
        caused by global warming, perpetuated in part by the burning of fossil fuels. Are you ready to switch to Green energy
        or are interested in upskilling to help others make that switch? Then this is your one stop shop for everything you 
        need to know.</p><br>

      <p>We also offer an online course that you can do at the comfort of your own home. 
        The course includes videos to help you grasp the concepts covered. 
        It also includes short quizes to test your understanding of the content.
        You get an accredited certification that will attest to your green energy skill set.
